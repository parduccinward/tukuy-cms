# Implementation Notes

This folder contains **implementation logs** that document the actual code generation process for each development phase.

---

## Purpose

These are **progress logs**, not permanent documentation. They serve to:

1. **Track what was built** - Detailed record of files created and implementation decisions
2. **Document AI collaboration** - How the code was generated from documentation
3. **Provide context** - Understanding the development history
4. **Enable review** - Verify all requirements from dev docs were implemented

---

## Contents

- `02-environment.md` - Environment setup implementation (from docs/dev/02-environment.md)
- More will be added as development progresses (e.g., `03-structure.md`, etc.)

---

## Lifecycle

These files are useful during active development and can be:
- **Archived** after project completion
- **Deleted** once the project is stable and in production
- **Kept** if you want a historical record of the build process

They are separate from the permanent documentation in `docs/dev/` which describes **how** to work with the code, while these describe **what** was built.

---

**Note:** These are numbered to match the corresponding dev docs (e.g., `02-environment.md` implements `docs/dev/02-environment.md`)
